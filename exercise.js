Breathing in, bend both knees to 90 degrees until your right thigh is parallel to the floor. Your hands can rest on your hips to help ensure your hips stay straight and don’t tip forward or back. At the bottom of your lunge, your right shin should be almost perpendicular to the floor, your right foot flat on the floor, and you should rest on your left toes (left heel elevated off the floor). Return to your starting position by exhaling as you push through both feet and squeeze your glutes to stand.",
